# World Happiness Report Project

## Project Overview
Data from the world happiness project collected by Gallup was downloaded from Kaggle.com and analyzed as the final project in an undergraduate data science course at North Seattle College.  The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the techniques for data analysis that have been learned throughout the course, including loading data, exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and transformation, joining, aggregation, and visualization. The main.ipynb file contains cells performing each of those techniques in sequence, using pandas dataframes and with visualizations created using the seaborn package.
